Pneumatic artificial muscle (PAM) has been widely applied to the rehabilitation field. On the other hand, PAMâ€™s high nonlinearity makes it difficult to achieve precise force and motion control. Efforts have been made to use springs to deal with the slow responses. However, the role of pre-tensioned springs and mechanical structures making good use of them have not been sufficiently investigated. In this study, three joint structures combined pre-tensioned springs and PAM were modeled. Their sliding mode controllers were designed, then the control results were compared with canonical antagonistic PAM structure. Results showed that the structure with three pre-tensioned springs had achieve better step response and control accuracy than canonical antagonistic PAM structure.
