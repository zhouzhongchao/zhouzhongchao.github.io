Upper limb prostheses are commonly propelled by pneumatic artificial muscles organized in an antagonistic arrangement. Nonetheless, the control of upper limb prostheses under changing/unknown situations is difficult and necessary for a variety of real-world applications. Adaptive control, learning-based control, and robust control have been studied to deal with such challenges. However, their adaptability is insufficient for prostheses used in daily life, which are exposed to variable task levels, user motor characteristics, and prosthetic features. This paper introduces a highly adaptive controller for the first time based on Generative Adversarial Nets and proportional–integral–derivative controller (G-PID controller). G-PID controller comprises a generator for generating compensation actions to enhance PID responsiveness when controlling the unknown/changing system. Moreover, it incorporates a discriminator that receives responses from both a user-preselected reference system and the compensated changing/unknown system, and simultaneously determines the source of these responses. Through continuous updates, the compensator modifies the response of unknown/changing system to align with the reference system, thereby facilitating adaptive control. The G-PID controller’s effectiveness is evaluated through 1-degree of freedom (DoF) joint and 2-DoF shoulder prostheses in simulation experiments, and further validated in prototype experiments focusing on online learning for unknown and time-varying payload. The results demonstrate its ability to deal with diverse types of unknowns/changes, marking a significant advancement towards incorporating prostheses seamlessly into daily life.
