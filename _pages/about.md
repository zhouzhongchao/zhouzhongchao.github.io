About me
======
Hi, welcome to my site! I am **Zhou Zhongchao(周忠潮,シユウ　チュウチョウ)**, an upcoming Project Researcher at [the Matsuo-Iwazawa Lab](https://weblab.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/) at the University of Tokyo, starting my role in April 2025. My academic journey has been shaped by a PhD degree from Chiba University, where I was supervised by [Prof Wenwei Yu](https://www.tms.chiba-u.jp/~yu/member_prof.html), and an enriching academic visit at Healthcare Biorobotics Lab (HBL) at the University of Oxford, supervised by [Prof Liang He](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/liang-he/). 
My research interests lie in the intersection of robotics and AI, including soft pneumatic robotics, modelling, control theory, machine learning applications in robot's control systems.

I am very interested in collaborations and various research opportunities. Feel free to contact me anytime!
