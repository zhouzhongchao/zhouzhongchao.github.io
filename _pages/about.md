About me
======
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Hi, welcome to my site! I am <strong>Zhou Zhongchao (周忠潮, シユウ チュウチョウ)</strong>, an upcoming Project Researcher at <a href="https://weblab.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/">the Matsuo-Iwazawa Lab</a> at the University of Tokyo, starting my role in April 2025. My academic journey has been shaped by a PhD degree from Chiba University, where I was supervised by <a href="https://www.tms.chiba-u.jp/~yu/member_prof.html">Prof Wenwei Yu</a>, and an enriching academic visit at Healthcare Biorobotics Lab (HBL) at the University of Oxford, supervised by <a href="https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/liang-he/">Prof Liang He</a>. 
My research interests lie in the intersection of robotics and AI, including soft pneumatic robotics, modelling, control theory, machine learning applications in robot's control systems.
